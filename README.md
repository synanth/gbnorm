## Notes

* [Release v0.99.1](https://github.com/ttdtrang/gbnorm/releases/tag/v0.99.1) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3628859.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3628859) is the first working snapshot of gbnorm. This version was used in the paper https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227760. In this implementation, all the functions taking expression matrix as an input assume that features (genes/transcripts) are in columns and samples are in rows.
